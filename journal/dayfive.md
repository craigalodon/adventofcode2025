# Day Five

Another unremarkable day. There are probably optimizations I could make to achieve
the union'ing without sorting and/or to store the results of the union in the
original `ranges` slice. However, the puzzle input is only about 1,000 lines long,
so there isn't really any practical need to optimize memory or sort time anyways.
