# Day Three

This was ... easier than expected. I thought I would need some sort of complicated data structure and, for an optimal solution, that might be true, but I was able to get the solution to part one done with just a couple of minutes of thinking. From there, it was trivial to generalize to a *k*-length battery bank.

I kept expecting some sort of gotcha, such as integer overflow, but everything was pretty much as it appeared on the surface. This was the first day where I had to think a little bit about how to handle IO, rather than read everything into memory at once. The solution was straightforward though—move the logic out of main.
