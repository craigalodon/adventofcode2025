# Advent Of Code 2025

Welcome to my attempt at [Advent Of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com).

I can't promise to complete it, let alone complete each day on the day of (I'm
already behind) but I wanted to make this public so that I could share and
discuss what I learned.

I'm using `Go` this time around in another attempt to learn the language better.
I have mixed feelings about it, but I think it is a great language for learning.

- There is generally only one way to do something, so you aren't distracted with
  learning syntactic sugar.
- The language is somewhat minimalistic, so you have to implement many common
  data structures and algorithms yourself.
  
Hopefully the repo structure will speak for itself. You can find my reflections
on the challenges in the [journal](./journal/).
